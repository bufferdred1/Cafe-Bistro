This is my Website upon a Cafe. You will find that it is a website about a Cafe menu and buisness franchise. The idea is to show the customer the cafe menu and make it attractive to them . They should have a full view of what is going on behind the cafe kitchen and also using css to make this attraction come to life. It will have in it, the name of the Cafe and the types of items that they sell the story about where the cafe was originated from. As you can imagine in a Cafe they sell hot Drinks and other beverages. There has to be a backstory to make this website ecciting and making the customer feel welcomed. This is my second project and i starterd off to a good start, im using the languages HTML, CSS and Java Script.
