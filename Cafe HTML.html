<h2 class="bronze"> About</h2>

 <p> Our susccess story for cafe bistro is often highlight as a small achievement, achieving
     something is still a rewarding. We created a 
     profitable business idea, the reason why it was small was that
    anybody could have thought of this idea, but we thought of it first.
   Focusing on our prize and mentaining our secrets for the buisness.
   it is simple, Quality ingredients and customer experience.
    For example, StarBucks Cafe  has received numerous awards,
    business Awards and earning the Good Food Award.
    Macdonalds, originally a cafe, became a successful 
    mobile catering business by focusing on outdoor events,
    demonstrating that adapting the business model can lead
    to success. Another key element 
    is building a brand around a specific strength, like a focus on high-quality
    coffee or unique dishes, coupled with excellent customer service and a strong 
    online presence.
